* `Cryptography is everywhere`:
  * Secure communication:–           web traffic: HTTPS
  * wireless traffic: 802.11i WPA2 (and WEP),GSM, Bluetooth
  * Encrypting files on disk:     EFS, TrueCrypt
  * Content protection (e.g. DVD, Blu-ray):CSS- Content scrambling system, AACS
  * User authentication


* `Secure socket layer`-   1. HANDSHAKE PROTOCOL– establish shared key using public key cryptography.
                         2. RECORD LAYER- Transmit data using shared secret key.

* `Single use key`- Key is only used to encrypt one message.
* `Multi use key`- key used to encrypt multiple messages.

* Cryptography is:
  – A tremendous tool
  – The basis for many security mechanisms
* Cryptography is not:
  – The solution to all security problems
  – Reliable unless implemented and used properly
  – Something you should try to invent yourself
* Many examples of broken ad-hoc designs

---

* Crypto can also do digital signatures and anonymous communications.

* The three steps in cryptography:
  * Precisely specify threat model
  * Propose a construction
  * Prove that breaking construction under threat mode will solve an underlying hard problem.

* History of cryptography-
1.	`Symmetric ciphers`- size of key space if 26 letters = 26!
2.	`Substitution ciphers`
3.	`Caesar ciphers (no key)`- Shift by 3
4.	`Vigenère ciphers`
5.	`Rotor machines`


Plaintext to ciphertext or ciphertext to plaintext using key.
