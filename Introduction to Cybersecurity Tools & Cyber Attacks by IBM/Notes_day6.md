* `Introduction to cryptography` : It is in simple words --> secret writing. Secure communication which can be understood by the intended recipient only. There is data in motion and data in rest both of which needs to be secured.
* Egyptians, Spartan Scytale, Caesar, Vigenere etc are some of the examples of historians which led the foundation of ancient cryptography.
* `Key concepts`:
  * Encryption
  * Decryption
  * Plaintext 
  * Ciphertext
  * Cipher
  * Cryptoanalysis.
  * CIA
  * Non-repudiation.

* Modern crypto uses modular maths as in `RSA` and `ECC`. Even exclusive XOR is a modern encryption.
* Steam cipher - encrpts and decrypts in bits.
* Block cipher - encrypts and decrypts in blocks.

* Types of cryptography: There are 3 types of modern encrpytion:
  * Symmetric
  * Asymmetric
  * Hash

* `Symmetric` - It uses the same key for encoding and decoding. The bigger the key, the stronger the algo. Examples - `AES` , `DES` , etc.
* `Asymmetric` - It uses two keys. One is the public key and the other is the private key. Example- Diffie-Hellman. Slower than symmetric. It uses one way algorithms to generate the keys like factorising prime numbers (n=p*q) etc.
* `Hash` - It provides encryption using algorithm without any key. A variable length plaintext is "hashed" into a fixed length hash value. Integrity is maintained in this type of encryption. Examples- `SHA-1` , `SHA-2` , `MD5`, etc.

* `Cryptography attacks` : 

  * Brute force
  * Rainbow tables
  * Social engineering
  * Known plaintext
  * Known ciphertext
