* `Challenges in cybersecurity` : 
  * Security not simple as it seems: Easy requirements --> Tough solutions
  * Solutions can be attacked themselves.
  * Protection of enforcement structure can complicate solutions.
  * Architectural decisions.
  * Management.
  * Protectors have to right everytime but the attackers need it only once to breach into the system.
  * No one likes security until it's needed.
  * Constant effort is needed.

* ##### Critical thinking helps us to come up with solutions and act in situations where there are no clear answers nor specific procedures.
* `Part art Part science`
* More data != more knowledge. 
* Nowadays, the answer to any problem is just "Google it". In these situations, original ideas and critical thinking becomes very important.
* Critical thinking can enable us to understand the security fundamentals in unknown, undefined and complex solutions and device the required solutions to it.
