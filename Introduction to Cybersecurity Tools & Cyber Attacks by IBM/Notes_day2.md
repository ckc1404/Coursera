* `Challenges` : 
  * Security not simple as it seems: Easy requirements --> Tough solutions
  * Solutions can be attacked themselves.
  * Protection of enforcement structure can complicate solutions.
  * Architectural decisions.
  * Management.
  * Protectors have to right everytime but the attackers need it only once to breach into the system.
  * No one likes security until it's needed.
  * Constant effort is needed.
* `Crtitical Thinking` : Cybersecurity is a diverse multifaced field.
  * Constantly changing environment.
  * Fast paced.
  * Multiple stakeholders.
  * Adversary presence.
